#Welcome to Baby Cloud

Baby Cloud is a photo upload, organization, and sharing web app with a focus on capturing baby photos throughout their development that can be shared with loved ones. Baby Cloud organizes the photos in a chronological timeline, using the metadata associated with the file.  The project is an on-going collaborative pair-programmed effort, implementing slick features such as drag-and-drop uploads and a responsive grid layout gallery.
